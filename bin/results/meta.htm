<span>&lt;span&gt;The Problem &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Worship leaders always sing and most play a melodic instrument like keyboard or guitar. Conveying &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;musical ideas to other musicians comes naturally. For example, a ‘C’ chord functions the same &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;regardless of the instrument playing it. Guitar, bass, keyboard, even woodwinds and brass instruments, &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;can find their place in it, along with the other various chords that make up our worship music.  &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;del style="background:#ffe6e6;"&gt;But&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"&gt;And&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;span&gt; all the familiar language of harmonic music breaks down when it comes to communicating with &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;drummers. Drummers do not speak in terms of chords or melodic lines. They do not occupy the same &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;sonic place as other harmonic instruments. Yet no one can deny how powerful (or problematic!) drums &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;can be to musical worship. However primitive an instrument, drums seem to use a language all their &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;own. And communicating ideas to them is often accompanied with anxiety for worship leaders of every &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;proficiency. So how exactly can you express musical ideas you’re not even sure how to verbalize them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;del style="background:#ffe6e6;"&gt; in &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;the first place&lt;/del&gt;&lt;span&gt;? &amp;para;&lt;br&gt; &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;The Solution &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;First things first - why are we here? &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"&gt;Let’s consider a few things…&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;span&gt; &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Confidence in our callings &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;You are their college, their teacher. Teach with grace that will not intimidate them. Even if you don’t &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;have all the knowledge, God has already provided for you everything you need to lead these people.  &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Know this is your role. Be decisive. You hold the sticks. &amp;para;&lt;br&gt; &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Redefine Greatness  &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Great drummers aren’t always those amazing technicians with inhuman capabilities. They are those who &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;can execute the right idea at the right time. They only occasionally need guidance. And when guide you &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;must, they will do everything they can to understand your idea first. They will not challenge it, shoot it &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;down, etc. They are quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. Great drummers are mature.   &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;  &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Winning the Mind Game &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;The drummer can be just as frightened as you are.  &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Appreciate their gift and the talent God has given them. You don’t have to prove anything.  &amp;para;&lt;br&gt; &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Learning the language &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Your voice. &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Describe what you need to get done &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Use trigger words &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Soft(er) &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Loud(er) &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Release &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Diamond &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Toms &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- March &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Power &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Space-y &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- More Guts/Power (Crescendo) &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Air &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Ethereal &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Light &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Fade in/out &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Endings &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;o Fade out &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;o Stay open &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;o Trash can &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;o Slow Down &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Hand signals &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Lope versus Loop &amp;para;&lt;br&gt; &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Three-layers &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Time signature (4/4, 6/8, 12/8)  &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- HH, SD, BD &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Four-on-the-floor &amp;para;&lt;br&gt; &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;Read the Road Map together &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Intro, Verse, Chorus, Turnaround, Bridge, Solo, Out &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Listen with them &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- The drummer must handle the scene changes &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Be familiar with the recordings and make them available &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;- Drummer must be flexible with structure; edit on the fly &amp;para;&lt;br&gt; &amp;para;&lt;br&gt; &amp;para;&lt;br&gt; &amp;para;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&para;<br></span>
