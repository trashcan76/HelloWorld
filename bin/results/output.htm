<span>The Problem &para;<br>Worship leaders always sing and most play a melodic instrument like keyboard or guitar. Conveying &para;<br>musical ideas to other musicians comes naturally. For example, a ‘C’ chord functions the same &para;<br>regardless of the instrument playing it. Guitar, bass, keyboard, even woodwinds and brass instruments, &para;<br>can find their place in it, along with the other various chords that make up our worship music.  &para;<br></span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">But</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">And</ins><span> all the familiar language of harmonic music breaks down when it comes to communicating with &para;<br>drummers. Drummers do not speak in terms of chords or melodic lines. They do not occupy the same &para;<br>sonic place as other harmonic instruments. Yet no one can deny how powerful (or problematic!) drums &para;<br>can be to musical worship. However primitive an instrument, drums seem to use a language all their &para;<br>own. And communicating ideas to them is often accompanied with anxiety for worship leaders of every &para;<br>proficiency. So how exactly can you express musical ideas you’re not even sure how to verbalize them</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> in &para;<br>the first place</del><span>? &para;<br> &para;<br>The Solution &para;<br>First things first - why are we here? &para;<br></span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">Let’s consider a few things…</ins><span> &para;<br>Confidence in our callings &para;<br>You are their college, their teacher. Teach with grace that will not intimidate them. Even if you don’t &para;<br>have all the knowledge, God has already provided for you everything you need to lead these people.  &para;<br>Know this is your role. Be decisive. You hold the sticks. &para;<br> &para;<br>Redefine Greatness  &para;<br>Great drummers aren’t always those amazing technicians with inhuman capabilities. They are those who &para;<br>can execute the right idea at the right time. They only occasionally need guidance. And when guide you &para;<br>must, they will do everything they can to understand your idea first. They will not challenge it, shoot it &para;<br>down, etc. They are quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. Great drummers are mature.   &para;<br>  &para;<br>Winning the Mind Game &para;<br>The drummer can be just as frightened as you are.  &para;<br>Appreciate their gift and the talent God has given them. You don’t have to prove anything.  &para;<br> &para;<br>Learning the language &para;<br>Your voice. &para;<br>Describe what you need to get done &para;<br>Use trigger words &para;<br>- Soft(er) &para;<br>- Loud(er) &para;<br>- Release &para;<br>- Diamond &para;<br>- Toms &para;<br>- March &para;<br>- Power &para;<br>- Space-y &para;<br>- More Guts/Power (Crescendo) &para;<br>- Air &para;<br>- Ethereal &para;<br>- Light &para;<br>- Fade in/out &para;<br>- Endings &para;<br>o Fade out &para;<br>o Stay open &para;<br>o Trash can &para;<br>o Slow Down &para;<br>- Hand signals &para;<br>- Lope versus Loop &para;<br> &para;<br>Three-layers &para;<br>- Time signature (4/4, 6/8, 12/8)  &para;<br>- HH, SD, BD &para;<br>- Four-on-the-floor &para;<br> &para;<br>Read the Road Map together &para;<br>- Intro, Verse, Chorus, Turnaround, Bridge, Solo, Out &para;<br>- Listen with them &para;<br>- The drummer must handle the scene changes &para;<br>- Be familiar with the recordings and make them available &para;<br>- Drummer must be flexible with structure; edit on the fly &para;<br> &para;<br> &para;<br> &para;<br></span>
