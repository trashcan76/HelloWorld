Each accelerated death benefit rider may be subject to requirements and limitations not&para;<br>specifically described in this quotation. See each rider for additional terms, conditions, and limitations.&para;<br> &para;<br>The QoL SelectChoice II Accelerated Death Benefit Riders allow you to receive a portion of the death benefit under the policy, during your&para;<br>lifetime, upon submission of required documentation regarding a qualifying event. The death benefit that you elect to accelerate will be paid at a&para;<br>discounted amount because it is being paid prior to the actual time of death. However, the accelerated death benefit you receive will not be less&para;<br>than the guaranteed minimum benefit based on different categories of illnesses, subject to the terms and conditions of the rider.&para;<br> &para;<br>QoL SELECTCHOICE II CRITICAL ILLNESS ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFIT RIDER (Form #ICC15-15604)&para;<br>The QoL SelectChoice II Critical Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Rider provides you access to your policy’s death benefit if you have one of the&para;<br>qualifying critical illnesses or conditions as specified below. There is a 30-day waiting period (90-day for Invasive Cancer) during which your&para;<br>policy must be in-force before the benefit from this rider is available.&para;<br> &para;<br>Qualifying Critical Illness&para;<br>•   The following critical illnesses or conditions are Qualifying Critical Illnesses under the rider:&para;<br>•    Major Heart Attack&para;<br>•    Coronary Artery Bypass&para;<br>•    Stroke&para;<br>•    Invasive Cancer&para;<br>•    Blood Cancers: Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Multiple Myeloma&para;<br>•    Major Organ Transplant&para;<br>•    End Stage Renal Failure&para;<br>•    Paralysis&para;<br>•    Coma&para;<br>•    Severe Burn&para;<br> &para;<br>If you have a qualifying critical illness, you can file a claim and accelerate all or a portion of your policy’s death benefit. Your benefit will be paid&para;<br>in the form of a lump sum payment.&para;<br> &para;<br>There is a guaranteed minimum benefit for the death benefit you choose to accelerate for a qualifying critical illness, depending on whether it is&para;<br>invasive cancer or other qualifying illness that is not invasive cancer. The actual chronic illness accelerated death benefit amount available to be&para;<br>paid as an accelerated death benefit will be based on our determination of the expected future mortality of a qualifying insured at the time an&para;<br>accelerated death benefit claim is made and will be at least as great as the guaranteed minimum benefit payout percentage multiplied by the death&para;<br>benefit you choose to accelerate and less certain deductions.&para;<br> &para;<br>If a benefit under the Critical Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Rider is payable, we will provide you  with one (1) opportunity to elect a Critical&para;<br>Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Amount as to the occurrence of the Qualifying Critical Illness in question. To make such an election, the Owner&para;<br>must complete an election form and return it to AGL within 60 days of the owner’s receipt of the election form.  For example, if you have a&para;<br>qualifying major heart attack, you will be provided an opportunity to elect a Critical Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Amount if you file a claim.&para;<br>If you elect not to receive an Accelerated Death Benefit, you will not be able to elect another Critical Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Amount&para;<br>for the same major heart attack. However, if you have another qualifying illness event later, you can still choose to accelerate your remaining death&para;<br>benefit.&para;<br> &para;<br>If, as to the occurrence of a Qualifying Critical Illness, You decide not to elect a Critical Illness Accelerated Death Benefit or if You decide to elect&para;<br>to receive less than the maximum Accelerated Death Benefit available for such Qualifying Critical Illness, You cannot thereafter elect a Critical&para;<br>Illness Accelerated Death Benefit and receive an Accelerated Death Benefit for the same occurrence of such Qualifying Critical Illness.&para;<br> &para;<br>QoL SELECTCHOICE II CHRONIC ILLNESS ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFIT RIDER (Form #ICC15-15603)&para;<br>The QoL SelectChoice II Chronic Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Rider provides you access to your policy’s death benefit if you have a&para;<br>qualifying chronic illness. There is a 30-day waiting period during which your policy must be in-force before the benefit from this rider is&para;<br>available. There is also an Elimination Period following the waiting period. The Elimination Period is a 90-day period in which you must be&para;<br>chronically ill before you become eligible for an accelerated death benefit.&para;<br> &para;<br>Qualifying Chronic Illness&para;<br>To qualify as chronically ill, you must be certified by a Licensed Health Care Practitioner within the preceding 12-month period as:&para;<br>   •  unable to perform, without Substantial Assistance from another person, at least two Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) for a period of at least&para;<br>       90 consecutive days due to a loss of functional capacity; or&para;<br>   •  Requires Substantial Supervision to protect such Insured Person from threats to health and safety due to Severe Cognitive Impairment;&para;<br>This Quotation is not complete unless all pages are included.

The actual accelerated&para;<br>death benefit payment that we will offer for acceleration will be based on our determination of the expected future mortality of a qualifying&para;<br>insured at the time an accelerated death benefit claim is made and will be at least as great as the Minimum Accelerated Benefit Amount, which is&para;<br>the greater of (1) the guaranteed payout percentage multiplied by the death benefit you choose to accelerate, less any loan amount and premium&para;<br>due, or (2) the pro rata portion of the Cash Surrender Value corresponding to the accelerated death benefit.&para;<br> &para;<br>Important Considerations&para;<br>The QoL SelectChoice II Accelerated Death Benefit Riders will impact the policy. The specified amount, policy values and outstanding loan&para;<br>balances will be reduced if an accelerated death benefit is paid. You should contact your personal tax advisor for specific advice before exercising&para;<br>these benefits.&para;<br> &para;<br>All provisions of the policy that do not conflict with this rider apply to this rider. Where there is any conflict between the rider provisions and the&para;<br>policy provisions, the rider provisions prevail.&para;<br> &para;<br>You should consider that receiving or having the contractual right to receive any Accelerated Death Benefit payment may affect your eligibility for&para;<br>Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or other government benefits or entitlements. You are advised to contact the Medicaid Unit of&para;<br>your local Department of Public Welfare and the Social Security Administration for more information.&para;<br> &para;<br>Benefits may be subject to taxation and may impact eligibility for Medicaid or other public assistance programs. Consult your legal and tax&para;<br>advisor for more information and refer to the rider for qualifications, limitations and fees.&para;<br> &para;<br>The owner should consult a competent tax advisor to determine the current tax consequences before requesting any accelerated death benefits.&para;<br>This rider is not intended to be a health contract, qualified long term care insurance contract under section 7702B(b) of the Internal Revenue Code&para;<br>or a non-qualified long term care insurance contract.&para;<br> &para;<br>Disclosures Applicable to Critical Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Rider, Chronic Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Rider, and Terminal&para;<br>Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Rider&para;<br>(1)   When filing a claim for Qualifying Critical Illness under a Critical Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Rider, for Qualifying Chronic Illness&para;<br>under a Chronic Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Rider or for Qualifying Terminal Illness under a Terminal Illness Accelerated Death Benefit&para;<br>Rider, the claimant must provide to the Company a completed claim form and then-current Certification which must be received at its&para;<br>Administrative Center.&para;<br> &para;<br>(2)   If a benefit under the Critical Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Rider is payable, the Company will provide the Owner with one (1)&para;<br>opportunity to elect a Critical Illness Accelerated Death Benefit Amount as to the occurrence of the Qualifying Critical Illness in question.
