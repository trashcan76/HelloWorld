<div class='EQUAL'>The Problem </br>Worship leaders always sing and most play a melodic instrument like keyboard or guitar. Conveying </br>musical ideas to other musicians comes naturally. For example, a ‘C’ chord functions the same </br>regardless of the instrument playing it. Guitar, bass, keyboard, even woodwinds and brass instruments, </br>can find their place in it, along with the other various chords that make up our worship music.  </br></div>
<div class='DELETE'>But</div>
<div class='INSERT'>And</div>
<div class='EQUAL'> all the familiar language of harmonic music breaks down when it comes to communicating with </br>drummers. Drummers do not speak in terms of chords or melodic lines. They do not occupy the same </br>sonic place as other harmonic instruments. Yet no one can deny how powerful (or problematic!) drums </br>can be to musical worship. However primitive an instrument, drums seem to use a language all their </br>own. And communicating ideas to them is often accompanied with anxiety for worship leaders of every </br>proficiency. So how exactly can you express musical ideas you’re not even sure how to verbalize them</div>
<div class='DELETE'> in </br>the first place</div>
<div class='EQUAL'>? </br> </br>The Solution </br>First things first - why are we here? </br></div>
<div class='INSERT'>Let’s consider a few things…</div>
<div class='EQUAL'> </br>Confidence in our callings </br>You are their college, their teacher. Teach with grace that will not intimidate them. Even if you don’t </br>have all the knowledge, God has already provided for you everything you need to lead these people.  </br>Know this is your role. Be decisive. You hold the sticks. </br> </br>Redefine Greatness  </br>Great drummers aren’t always those amazing technicians with inhuman capabilities. They are those who </br>can execute the right idea at the right time. They only occasionally need guidance. And when guide you </br>must, they will do everything they can to understand your idea first. They will not challenge it, shoot it </br>down, etc. They are quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. Great drummers are mature.   </br>  </br>Winning the Mind Game </br>The drummer can be just as frightened as you are.  </br>Appreciate their gift and the talent God has given them. You don’t have to prove anything.  </br> </br>Learning the language </br>Your voice. </br>Describe what you need to get done </br>Use trigger words </br>- Soft(er) </br>- Loud(er) </br>- Release </br>- Diamond </br>- Toms </br>- March </br>- Power </br>- Space-y </br>- More Guts/Power (Crescendo) </br>- Air </br>- Ethereal </br>- Light </br>- Fade in/out </br>- Endings </br>o Fade out </br>o Stay open </br>o Trash can </br>o Slow Down </br>- Hand signals </br>- Lope versus Loop </br> </br>Three-layers </br>- Time signature (4/4, 6/8, 12/8)  </br>- HH, SD, BD </br>- Four-on-the-floor </br> </br>Read the Road Map together </br>- Intro, Verse, Chorus, Turnaround, Bridge, Solo, Out </br>- Listen with them </br>- The drummer must handle the scene changes </br>- Be familiar with the recordings and make them available </br>- Drummer must be flexible with structure; edit on the fly </br> </br> </br> </br></div>
